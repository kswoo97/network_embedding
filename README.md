# Studying various network(graph) embedding methods

### Introduction

- Used numpy in implementing
- Used Karate network(Zachary, W. W. (1977). "An Information Flow Model for Conflict and Fission in Small Groups". Journal of Anthropological Research.)
- For LINE algorithm, foolball data(T.S. Evans. (2010). "Clique Graphs and Overlapping Communities") was also used.
- Jupyter notebooks show the result of the algorithm
